# My Nvim Config

It works in 3 models:

- vscode + vscode neovim plugins
- Neovim
- vim in vimrc `simple and for other tools don't support neovim like vs and qtcreator `

## Todo

- make all(almost) keyboard shortcut writed in neovim mapping. the reason are that neovim mapping is easy to config and vscode sync sometimes mistake.
